For an independent implementation without Require.js, further functionality involving auto-loading dependencies will not be present, so these javascript dependencies and templates will need to be defined directly on the DOM. \r\n\r\n```js\r\n// These examples will be expanded\r\nif (tbd) console.log('tbd');\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### Plugins\r\n\r\nPlugins are simple objects that provide Design functionality to DOM elements, independent of a model or collection, which effectively removes all API support.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// These examples will be expanded\r\nif (tbd) console.log('tbd');\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### Widgets\r\n\r\nWidgets are complex objects that provide API and Design functionality to DOM elements, which include a model or collection for API support.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// These examples will be expanded\r\nif (tbd) console.log('tbd');\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Contributions\r\n\r\nAlways welcome.
